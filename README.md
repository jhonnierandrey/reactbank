#### Description:
<p> Before start getting into my Final Project details, I really want to thank the CS50 Team for the amazing quality of the lectures, each detail was incredible usefull and I will be always remembering all that I learned with you. </p>
<p>David, Doug, Brian, you guys really enjoy teaching and we can feel it with every lecture, thank you for that willingness to share what you know, really appreciate it.</p>
<p> This project was inspired by CS50 Financial practice, I created this FullStack App that uses a ReactJS FrontEnd, also some great technologies such as: Bootstrap, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript. </p>
